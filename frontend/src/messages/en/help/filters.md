# Filter tasks by team member

You can filter tasks by team members that are part of your workspace by using
the **side menu**. Filtering tasks by team member allows you to see tasks a certain team
member is working on.

You can apply more than one filter at a time. Go to the **Team members**
section in the side menu, select one or more
team members, and filter the current
project's task by pressing the **Filter** button at the bottom of the side
menu.
You can also filter by tasks that have been
assigned to nobody by selecting **Assigned to nobody**.

Next to each team member's name you can also see the amount of tasks that have
been assigned to them. This is useful in determining which team team members
are available for new tasks to be assigned to them.

# Filter tasks by label

You can filter tasks by labels that you have created in the **Labels**
section in the **side menu**.

Filtering tasks by label
allows you to see similar tasks at the same time.

You can apply more than one filter at a time. Go to the **Labels** section in the
side menu. From there you can select one or more labels. Press
the **Filter** button at the bottom of the side menu to filter
project tasks by the labels you've selected.

You can also filter tasks that have no label assigned to them by selecting
**No label**.

# Search tasks by keyword

The search box located on top of the project page gives you the ability to
further narrow down tasks. You can search tasks by:

- **Task number**
- **Task title**
- **Section title**

Enter your search terms in the field labeled **Task search** and search by
clicking **Search tasks** below the **Task search** field, or by pressing the
**Filter** button at the bottom of the side menu.

If no tasks have been found, you can reenter your search terms in the field
above.

# Combining filters and search

You can filter tasks by both team member and labels at the same time. This lets
you see, for example, if a specific team member has
a specific type of task assigned to them. Select the team member and label that
you're interested in from the side menu and press the **Filter** button to see
only tasks that are assigned to that team member and with the label that you've
selected.

Further, you can filter tasks and enter a search query. Maybe you want
to filter all “Design” tasks for a specific team member, while only showing
tasks that contain the words “Landing page” in their title.

In that case, you'd select your team member's name, select the “Design“ label, and
enter the search query “Landing page” in the **Task search** field. Confirm
your search by pressing the **Search tasks** or **Filter** button.
