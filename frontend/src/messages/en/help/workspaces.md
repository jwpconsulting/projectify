# Create a workspace

When you make an account with the Projectify app you will automatically have
one workspace created for you as part of the onboarding.

To create more workspaces [visit this URL](/onboarding/new-workspace). Go
through the onboarding process there one more time to create a new workspace.

# Switch workspaces

To switch between workspaces, click the **workspace selector** in the side
menu. This will expand a list where you can switch between different
workspaces associated with your account. The workspace selector is the topmost
element in the side menu and shows your current workspace name.

# Workspace settings

To go to the workspace settings, click the **workspace selector** in the side
menu to expand it, then click **Workspace Settings** at the top of the list.

The workspace settings consist of six tabs:

- **General**,
- **Projects**,
- **Labels**,
- **Team members**,
- **Billing**, and
- **Quota**,

The **General** tab provides information on your current workspace such as the name of
the workspace.

The **Projects** tab shows all projects in your workspace, including
archived ones. You can edit, archive, and delete your projects.
To learn more about the projects tab, visit the [projects help](/help/projects).

The **Labels** tab allows you to create, edit and delete labels for
organizing your tasks.
To learn more about the labels tab, visit the [labels help](/help/labels).

The **Team members** tab allows you to add, edit permissions and delete
team members.
To learn more about the team members tab, visit the [team members help](/help/team-members).

The **Billing** tab provides a way for you to amend your account billing
details.
To learn more about the billing tab, visit the [billing help](/help/billing).

The **Quota** tab shows you how many more items you can create in your
Projectify workspace.
To learn more about the quota tab, visit the [workspace quota help](/help/quota).
