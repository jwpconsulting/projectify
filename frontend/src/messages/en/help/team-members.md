You need to be workspace owner to invite or remove team members and edit their
permissions. [Learn more about roles here](/help/roles).

# Invite a team member

To invite a team member, go to the **Team** tab in the workspace
settings. You can access the workspace settings by clicking the **workspace
selector** in the side menu to expand it, then clicking **Workspace Settings**
at the top of the list. From there select the **Team** tab.

From this page, you can send invites for team members to access your workspace
by entering their email addresses and clicking the **Invite team member**
button.

We'll take care of the rest. Be aware that you will not be able to invite team
members if you do not have enough seats available in your workspace.

To understand how many seats you have available in your workspace, see the
[Workspace quotas](/help/quota) help page.

## Removing an invite

To remove an invite before it's accepted, scroll down to the **Team member
invites** section on the same page. Click the **Uninvite** button next to the
email address you want to remove. An overlay will ask you to confirm your
choice.

# Assign a task to a team member

There are two ways to assign a team member to a task. If you are creating a
task for the first time, you have the option to assign it to a team member
under **Assignee** field.

You can assign a team member to a task after you've created the task,
or change an existing assignment.

Go to the task page by clicking on the task and open the
task edit page by clicking the **Edit** button in the top right. Under the
**Assignee** section, select a team member by selecting the radio button
next to their name, or select "Assigned to nobody" to remove the current assignment. Click
**Update task** in the top right corner to save your changes.

# Filter tasks by team members

You can filter tasks by the team members in your workspace by using
the side menu. This lets
you see all tasks that a certain team
member is working on.

You can apply more than one filter at a time. Go to the **Team members**
section in the side menu and make sure it is open by clicking the **Arrow
button** on the right side. From there you can filter team members.

Filtering a team member also allows you to see how many tasks that team member
has assigned to them. This feature is great in determining which team team
members are available for new tasks to be assigned to them.

# Edit a team member's permissions

You need to be workspace owner to edit team member permissions.

To edit team member permissions, go to the **Team** tab in the
workspace settings. You can access the workspace settings by clicking the
**workspace selector** in the side menu to expand it, then clicking **Workspace
Settings** at the top of the list. From there select the **Team** tab.

Click the **Pencil button** next to a team member's role to edit their
permissions. Your changes will be automatically saved when you make your
selection.

For more on permissions, please see our guide on [team member roles and
permissions](/help/roles).

# Delete a team member

To delete a team member, go to the **Team** tab in the workspace
settings. Click the **Remove** button next to the team member you want to
remove. An overlay will open asking you to confirm your choice. Once you have
removed a team member, you can add them again using the steps from the section
above _Invite a team member_.

Please keep in mind that you can not remove yourself as a team member from your
workspace.
