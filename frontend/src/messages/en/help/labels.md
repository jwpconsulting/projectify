# Create a label

Labels allow you to bring some organization to your tasks.

To create a label, go to your workspace settings and navigate
to the **Labels** tab and then click the **Add label** button
at the bottom of the list.

This will open up a form where you can write the name of your new label as
well as choose a color for it. Click the **Create label** button to create your new
label.

# Assign a label to a task

There are two ways to assign a label to a task.

If you are creating a task for the first time, you have the option to assign a
label to the task using the **Labels** field in the task creation form.

To assign labels to a task that you have already created, you can edit
the task by clicking on the task title and using the **Labels** field in the
task update form.

# Edit a label

Go to your workspace settings and navigate to the **Labels** tab. Click on the label name or the pencil icon next to the label you want to edit.

This will open the same form as creating a label, but this time the name and
color will be filled in. From here you can edit the name of the label as well
as change the color of the label. Click the **Save** button to keep your
changes. You can go back by clicking the **Go back** button.

# Filter by labels

You can filter and search labels that you have created by using the side menu.

Searching for labels helps you to find a label quickly and filtering by label
allows you to see similar tasks at the same time.

You can apply more than one filter at a time. Open the _label menu_ in the side
menu and from there you can either search for a label or filter labels.

# Delete a label

To delete a label, go to your workspace settings and navigate to the **Labels** tab.
Click the **Delete** button next to the label you want to remove and confirm your choice to
delete this label.
