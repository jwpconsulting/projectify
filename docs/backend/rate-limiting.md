# Rate limiting implementation:

We use
[Django Ratelimit, since the documentation specifically mentions security](https://django-ratelimit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/security.html)
to implement rate limiting. Requests we want to rate limit are:

- Requests that send emails as a consequence
- Log in / sign up requests

Another candidate was DRF's
[UserRateThrottle](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/throttling/#userratethrottle).
Django Rest Framework invites developers to rate limit the views, but less for
security reasons. Django Rest Framework's Throttling documentation mentions
that it is not to be used as a security measure or DDoS protection.

It might also make sense to throttle services directly, not views. Any view
that is usable even when not authenticated is suited to be throttled directly.
Perhaps some services that are only usable when authenticated might be
throttlable themselves. For now, we will keep throttling to views only.

# TODO

- [ ] Handle properly in frontend based on 429 status for ChangePassword,
      RequestEmailAddressUpdate and InviteUserToWorkspace

# Views to be rate limited

Views to be rate limited in the **user** app:

- `RequestEmailAddressUpdate`, it sends an email with a confirm link
- `SignUp`, it sends an email with a confirm link
- `ChangePassword`, it informs users via email about the password change
- `PasswordResetRequest`, it sends a password reset link
- `LogIn`, we don't want credential stuffing or dictionary attacks.

For credential stuffing, we expect possibly several IPs trying out many
different email and password combinations, so limiting purely based on email is
futile. For dictionary attacks, we want to monitor the amount of failed
attempts per email address.

Views to be rate limited in the **workspace** app:

- `InviteUserToWorkspace`, sends an email to a user if they haven't created an
  account yet

# Rate limit settings

There are three types of rate limiting:

- using the user id (per user) as rate limiting key,
- using the request IP for not logged in users as rate limiting key, and
- using the contents of the request as a rate limiting key.

These three types can appear together by stacking Django-Ratelimit decorators.
Optionally, these limits can only come to effect under certain conditions, such
as requests failing

- `SignUp` and `PasswordResetRequest` are used as an anonymous user, therefore
  we rate limit _per IP_. We want to rate limit based on the email address
  specified in the request as well.
- `LogIn` invites attackers to try stuffing credentials, so we want to filter
  based on IP (credential stuffing), email address, but also for failed
  attempts for the same email (dictionary attack).
- `ChangePassword`, `RequestEmailAddressUpdate`, and `InviteUserToWorkspace`
  are only usable when authenticated, therefore we rate limit _per user_.

Rate limits should be:

- `SignUp`, 5 times per hour _per IP_ (if successful), 60 times per hour _per
  IP_ (regardless of success)
- `PasswordResetRequest`, 5 times per hour _per IP_, 5 times per hour _per
  request email_
- `RequestEmailAddressUpdate`, 5 times per hour _per user_
- `ChangePassword`, 5 times per hour _per user_
- `InviteUserToWorkspace`, 10 times per hour _per user_
- `LogIn`, 5 times per minute _per IP_, 5 times per hour _per request email_ on failure.

# How to rate limit services instead (idea)

If we want to enforce n times per email address per hour for authentication
services, we can rate limit inside the service code instead.

For example, `user_sign_up`, could be something like this:

```python
def user_sign_up(
  *,
  email: str,
  password: str,
  tos_agreed: bool,
  privacy_policy_agreed: bool,
) -> User:
    """Sign up a user."""
  validate_rate(key=email, rate='60/d')
  # Check if user exists
  if user_find_by_email(email=email) is not None:
    pass
  # ... Rest
```

Where `validate_rate` throws a `exceptions.Throttled` DRF exception.
