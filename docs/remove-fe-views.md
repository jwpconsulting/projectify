This document details the Django views that are necessary to replace the Svelte
frontend.

Refer to `docs/remove-fe-pages.md` for a list of all pages that you have to
recreate.

Where overlays where used to create resources, create new views instead. For
example, users create sections using a section `ConstructiveOverlay`
in the SvelteKit frontend. Instead, a new `section_create` view offers this
feature on a separate page. This simplifies page navigation, usability, and
accessibility.

Where context menus are used to manipulate resources, create new views instead.
For example, users can move tasks up or down, or to different sections
using the task context menu. Create a new `task_context_menu` view to
achieve this in a new page instead. This view presents a form with
buttons to perform actions on a given task. When the user submits the form,
the backend performs the desired action, such as moving a task up or down.

# Storefront

In `backend/projectify/storefront/views.py`, add the following views:

```python
def accessibility(request: HttpRequest) -> HttpResponse: pass
def contact_us(request: HttpRequest) -> HttpResponse: pass
def credits(request: HttpRequest) -> HttpResponse: pass
def ethicalads(request: HttpRequest) -> HttpResponse: pass
def free_software(request: HttpRequest) -> HttpResponse: pass
def pricing(request: HttpRequest) -> HttpResponse: pass
def privacy(request: HttpRequest) -> HttpResponse: pass
def security_disclose(request: HttpRequest) -> HttpResponse: pass
def security_general(request: HttpRequest) -> HttpResponse: pass
def solutions_index(request: HttpRequest) -> HttpResponse: pass
def solutions_detail(request: HttpRequest, page: str) -> HttpResponse: pass
def tos(request: HttpRequest) -> HttpResponse: pass
```

## Help

This is separate from the storefront pages to make organizing the markdown help
documents easier.

In `backend/projectify/help/views.py`, add the following views:

```python
def help_index(request: HttpRequest) -> HttpResponse: pass
def help_detail(request: HttpRequest, page: str) -> HttpResponse: pass
```

# Onboarding

All views during onboarding require the user to be logged in.

In `backend/projectify/onboarding/views.py`, add the following views:

```python
@require_http_methods(["GET", "POST"])
def about_you(request: HttpRequest) -> HttpResponse:
    """
    Add a preferred name and profile picture for the current user,

    GET:
    Show page with form
    POST:
    On success: Update user profile. Redirect user to /onboarding/new-workspace
    On failure: Show this page again with errors
    """

@require_http_methods(["GET", "POST"])
def new_workspace(request: HttpRequest) -> HttpResponse:
    """

    """


@require_http_methods(["GET", "POST"])
def new_project(request: HttpRequest, workspace_uuid: UUID) -> HttpResponse:
    """

    GET: Show project creation form for `workspace_uuid`
    POST:
    On success: Create new project inside the workspace. Redirect user to
    /onboarding/new-task/<project-uuid> with the project UUID coming from the
    newly created project.
    On error: Show project creation form with errors
    """


@require_http_methods(["GET", "POST"])
def new_task(request: HttpRequest, project_uuid: UUID) -> HttpResponse:
    """

    task.

    POST:
    On success: Creates a section and task and assigns it to the user. Redirect
    user to onboarding/new-label/<task-uuid> with the task uuid coming

@require_http_methods(["GET", "POST"])
def new_label(request: HttpRequest, task_uuid: UUID) -> HttpResponse:
    """

    GET:

    POST:

    """Show the user that Projectify assigned the task to them."""
